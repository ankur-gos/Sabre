  This function should return a list of two agents that will form the

  As a potentially helpful development aid, this function can take
  additional string-valued keyword arguments ("first" and "second" are
  such arguments in the case of this function), which will come from
  the --redOpts and --blueOpts command-line arguments to capture.py.
  For the nightly contest, however, your team will be created without
  any extra arguments, so you should make sure that the default
  behavior is what you want for the nightly contest.

  Idea 1 (Rush Strat):
    Basic Idea: Both agents available to us are on offense

    If the other team runs a standard 1 offense, 1 defense, we will be able to beat them.
    The idea is that one pacman runs diversion while the other scoops up pellets. When
    the diversion pacman (dp) dies, he runs an effecient defense back towards the other
    end of the field. The other pacman then becomes dp once the other pacman reenters the field.
